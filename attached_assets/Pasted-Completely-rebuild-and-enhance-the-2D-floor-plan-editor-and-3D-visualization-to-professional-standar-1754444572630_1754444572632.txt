Completely rebuild and enhance the 2D floor plan editor and 3D visualization to professional standards that rival SketchUp and RoomSketcher. Here's exactly what I need:
üéØ 2D Floor Plan Editor - Make it Professional
Core Drawing Tools:

Precision wall drawing with snap-to-grid (1-foot increments) and angle constraints (45¬∞, 90¬∞)
Smart wall joining that automatically connects and creates corners
Dimension display showing real measurements as you draw (feet and inches)
Room auto-detection that recognizes enclosed spaces and labels them
Magnetic snap points for precise alignment of walls, doors, and windows

Advanced Features:

Door/window library with standard sizes (32", 36" doors, various window styles)
Drag-and-drop placement with automatic wall cutting for openings
Wall thickness options (4", 6", 8", 10") with proper framing representation
Electrical symbols (outlets, switches, lighting) that snap to walls
Plumbing fixtures (sinks, toilets, showers) with proper spacing guides
Measurement tools with running dimensions and area calculations per room
Layer system for electrical, plumbing, structural elements

Professional Polish:

Clean, architectural line weights (thick for walls, thin for dimensions)
Room labels with automatic square footage calculations
North arrow and scale indicator
Print-ready layouts with title blocks and drawing notes

üéÆ 3D Visualization - Make it Stunning
Rendering Quality:

Realistic wood textures with proper grain direction and material properties
Dynamic lighting system with natural sunlight simulation and interior lighting
Shadow casting that updates based on time of day and season
Material reflection/roughness for glass, metal, stone surfaces
High-resolution textures (at least 1024px) for wood, stone, metal finishes

Navigation & Controls:

Smooth camera controls - orbit, pan, zoom with momentum and easing
First-person walkthrough mode with WASD controls and mouse look
Preset camera angles (front, back, sides, aerial, interior views)
Cinematic camera paths for automatic tours through the cabin
VR-ready viewing for immersive experience

Real-time Features:

Instant updates when 2D plan changes - no refresh needed
Material swapping with live preview (click any surface to change material)
Furniture placement in 3D with collision detection
Lighting controls (toggle interior lights, adjust sun position)
Weather effects (rain, snow, different seasons) for exterior visualization

üîÑ Seamless 2D ‚Üî 3D Integration

Synchronized editing - changes in 2D instantly reflect in 3D
Click-to-edit from 3D view (click a wall in 3D to edit it in 2D)
Split-screen mode showing both views simultaneously
Measurement overlay in 3D showing dimensions when hovering over elements

üì± Performance & Usability
Technical Requirements:

60fps performance on standard devices (don't sacrifice speed for features)
Progressive loading - basic structure loads fast, details load progressively
Mobile optimization with touch controls and responsive design
Undo/redo system with unlimited history
Auto-save every 30 seconds to prevent data loss

User Experience:

Contextual help bubbles explaining tools as users hover
Smart suggestions (proper door swing directions, standard room sizes)
Template integration - users can start with proven cabin layouts
Export options - high-res images, PDFs, and 3D model files

üèóÔ∏è Cabin-Specific Features
Structural Elements:

Log construction visualization with authentic log stacking and chinking
Timber frame representation with proper beam and joint connections
Foundation options (concrete slab, pier and beam, full basement)
Roofing materials (metal, shingles, cedar shake) with proper overhangs
Porch and deck builders with railing and support post placement

Construction Details:

Framing view toggle showing 2x4, 2x6, 2x8 lumber placement
Insulation visualization for energy efficiency planning
Utility routing showing electrical and plumbing paths through walls

Make this feel like using a modern, professional design tool - not a basic hobby app. Users should be impressed within the first 30 seconds of use.*
