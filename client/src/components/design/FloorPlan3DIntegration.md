# 3D Geometry Generation from 2D Floor Plans

## Overview
The Professional3DViewer now supports comprehensive 3D geometry generation from 2D floor plan data created in the Professional2DEditor. This system converts 2D wall data, doors, windows, and rooms into optimized 3D meshes with proper materials and cabin-specific features.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. 2D to 3D Data Conversion
- **Wall Conversion**: Converts 2D wall segments to 3D wall meshes with proper thickness and height
- **Coordinate System**: Transforms 2D canvas coordinates (X,Y) to 3D world coordinates (X,Y,Z) with Y-up
- **Opening Integration**: Automatically includes doors and windows from 2D editor as 3D openings

### 2. Wall Mesh Generation
- **BufferGeometry**: Uses Three.js BufferGeometry for optimal performance
- **Proper Thickness**: Walls have configurable thickness (4", 6", 8", 10") converted from inches to feet
- **Height Support**: Walls extend from floor to ceiling height
- **Opening Cutouts**: Wall segments are split around door and window openings

### 3. Door and Window Generation
- **Door Frames**: Generates 3D door frames with proper depth and materials
- **Door Panels**: Creates door panels that can be opened/closed (future enhancement)
- **Window Frames**: Multi-part window frames with proper joinery
- **Window Sills**: Generates window sills extending beyond wall surface
- **Glass Panels**: Transparent glass with proper material properties

### 4. Foundation System
- **Foundation Types**: Supports slab, crawlspace, and full basement foundations
- **Automatic Sizing**: Foundation automatically sized based on wall boundaries
- **Material Support**: Stone, concrete, or brick foundation materials

### 5. Floor and Ceiling Generation  
- **Floor Geometry**: Generates floor planes within room boundaries
- **Ceiling Geometry**: Creates ceilings at proper height
- **Material Mapping**: Supports wood flooring, tile, carpet, etc.

### 6. Roof Generation
- **Multiple Types**: Gable, Hip, Shed, and Gambrel roof styles
- **Pitch Configuration**: Configurable roof pitch in degrees
- **Overhang Support**: Automatic roof overhangs
- **Material Options**: Metal, shingles, cedar shake, etc.

### 7. Cabin-Specific Features
- **Porch Generation**: Automatically creates front porches with posts and roofing
- **Deck Construction**: Side/back decks with railings and proper support
- **Log Construction**: Special handling for log cabin wall construction
- **A-Frame Support**: Specialized geometry for A-frame cabin styles

### 8. Optimization and Performance
- **Geometry Merging**: Combines adjacent faces for better performance
- **Material Instancing**: Reuses materials across similar elements
- **Shadow Optimization**: Proper shadow casting and receiving
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of disposed geometries

## Material System

### Expanded Material Library
The system now includes 15+ materials:
- Cedar Siding
- Metal Roofing  
- Stone Foundation
- Window Glass
- Interior Drywall
- Wood Flooring
- Door/Window Frames
- Deck Materials
- Concrete
- Brick
- Asphalt Shingles

### Material Properties
Each material includes:
- Physically-based rendering (PBR) properties
- Color, roughness, metalness values
- Optional diffuse and normal maps
- Proper transparency settings

## Real-Time Updates

### Live Synchronization
- Changes in 2D editor instantly reflect in 3D view
- Automatic geometry regeneration on data changes
- Memory leak prevention with proper disposal
- Smooth performance during updates

### Integration Points
The system integrates at these key points:
1. **Wall Changes**: Adding/removing/modifying walls
2. **Opening Changes**: Adding/removing doors and windows
3. **Room Detection**: Automatic room boundary updates
4. **Material Changes**: Real-time material swapping
5. **Dimension Changes**: Height, width, length modifications

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In the Professional2DEditor, changes to editorState trigger 3D updates:
const editorState = {
  walls: [
    {
      id: 'wall-1',
      start: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      end: { x: 240, y: 0 }, // 20 feet
      thickness: 6, // 6 inches
      type: 'exterior'
    }
  ],
  doors: [
    {
      id: 'door-1', 
      wallId: 'wall-1',
      position: 0.5, // Center of wall
      width: 36, // 36 inches
      swing: 'right',
      type: 'entry'
    }
  ],
  windows: [
    {
      id: 'window-1',
      wallId: 'wall-1', 
      position: 0.25, // 25% along wall
      width: 48, // 48 inches
      height: 36, // 36 inches
      sillHeight: 30, // 30 inches
      type: 'double'
    }
  ]
};

// Professional3DViewer receives this data and generates:
// - 3D wall mesh with door and window openings
// - Door frame and panel at center position
// - Window frame, sill, and glass at 25% position
// - Proper materials and textures applied
```
